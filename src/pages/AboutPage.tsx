              Wesean Times was born from a dreamâ€”a dream to unite every Wesean heart, from the youngest to the eldest, under one voice. Led by Salindra Chettri, Co-Advisor of the Wesean High School Students Forum, and Chesa Bhutia, Advisor of the Wesean High School Forum, this newspaper is more than ink on paper; it's a bridge between our past and our future, a call to honor the depth of our culture and the resilience of our people.

              Every article, every story carries a pulse of Wesea's spirit, woven with pride, love, and hope. Through these pages, we stand together as one Wesean family, honoring our roots and shaping the legacy we'll leave for generations to come.
